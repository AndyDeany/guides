# Short Grain Rice

These instructions are for cooking short grain rice.
You should end up with something similar to the sticky rice
that is served in Japanese restaurants.


## Ingredients

* 1 dl rice per person

* 1 dl cold water per person

You will also need a large-ish saucepan with a secure lid.


## Steps

* Wash the rice, preferably by swirling around in a bowl of cold water,
but rinsing it in a sieve or colander will work fine too.

* Put the water and rice in the pan, and then place it on the stove.
Turn the heat up to high and put the lid on the pan.
Do **not** take the lid off until instructed to do so.

* When it starts to boil (should take around 3-5 minutes depending
on how much you're making), turn the heat as low as it can go
without turning it off.

* After around 15 minutes, almost all of the water should have evaporated.
When you think this is the case, turn the heat back up to full for between
30 and 60 seconds. This should evaporate any remaining water.

* Turn off the heat. Move the pan to a cooler part of the stove.
Let the pan sit for 10-20 minutes.

* Take the lid off. With a wooden spoon, move the rice around the pan
to fluff it up.

* The rice is now ready to eat! If you aren't ready to eat it just yet though,
place the lid back on the pan. It will stay warm for a little while.
